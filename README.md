# 🧵 Fashion MNIST: PCA & Dimensionality Reduction Analysis  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project explores **dimensionality reduction techniques** applied to the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, a popular benchmark dataset for image classification. The goal is to reduce the dataset’s **high-dimensional space** into **2D representations**, enabling better visualization and analysis while retaining meaningful information.  

We employ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and compare it with an **alternative dimensionality reduction technique** to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of **variance retention** and **class separability**.

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔️ Apply **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) to project high-dimensional image data into **2D space**.  
✔️ Visualize results using **scatter plots**, with distinct colors for each class.  
✔️ Compare PCA with another **dimensionality reduction technique** (e.g., **t-SNE, LDA, or Autoencoders**).  
✔️ Analyze **variance ratio retention** to determine the best method.  
✔️ Discuss real-world applications of dimensionality reduction in **machine learning and AI**.

## 📊 Methods & Techniques Used  

### 🔹 **1️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Reduces dataset dimensions to **2D**.
- **Eigenvalue decomposition** is used to retain maximum variance.
- **Explained variance ratio** is computed to measure retained information.
- Generates **scatter plots** for visualization.

### 🔹 **2️⃣ Alternative Dimensionality Reduction Method**
- Implements another technique (**t-SNE, LDA, Autoencoders, or UMAP**).
- Compares **variance retention and class separability**.
- Visualizes results using **scatter plots**.

### 🔹 **3️⃣ Conceptual Analysis**
- Compares variance retention between both methods.
- Evaluates which method provides **better class separation**.
- Discusses real-world implications in **AI, deep learning, and big data**.
